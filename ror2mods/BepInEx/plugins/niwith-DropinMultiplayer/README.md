# DropinMultiplayer
The drop in multiplayer mod for Risk of Rain 2!
This mod allows the host to have players join mid-game, and automatically gives them items to help them catch up!

If you have any bug reports, ping me on the modding discord (https://discord.gg/MfQtGYj), you can make an issue on the github if you want, but I'll level with you, I'll probably forget to check it.
